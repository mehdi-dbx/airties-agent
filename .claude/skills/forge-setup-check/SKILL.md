# Agent Forge — Setup: check

Runs a full verification pass of all configured resources and presents a clean summary.

## Flow

### 1. Run the check

```bash
cd /Users/mehdi.lamrani/code/code/agent-forge && uv run python scripts/py/setup_dbx_env.py --check 2>&1
```

### 2. Parse and present

Parse the output looking for `✓` (OK) and `✗` (FAIL) lines per section. Present a clean summary:

```

Summary
  [x]  2 checks failed
```

### 3. Offer remediation

For each [x], show which skill to run:

```
To fix:
  [x] checkin_agents missing    → /forge-setup-tables
  [x] app grants not applied    → run: ! ./deploy/grant/run_all_grants.sh

Run a specific step? Or type "all good" to exit.
```

If user names a step → immediately invoke that skill's flow.

If all [+] → show:
```
[+] All resources OK — Agent Forge is ready to deploy.

Run /dbx-deploy when you're ready.
```

## Error cases

- `--check` command fails entirely (auth broken): show error and suggest `/forge-setup-auth` first
- Grants failing: remind user the app must be deployed first before grants can be applied
